Always include the following information in your bug report: the name
and version number of your compiler; the name and version number of
your operating system; the version of qx11Grab you are using, and what
configure options it was compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run. Often,
such a program can be created with some minor changes to one of the many
example programs in qx11Grab's examples directory, or to the autotests that
are available in the public source repository on http://gitweb.hjcms.de/.
